Poem-o-matic is a friendly "bot-in-a-box" that prints out a keepsake poem just for you when you press its button. We hope you'll snap an insta of your poem and share it with your social network to spread @omiamifestival around the world. Poem-o-matic is a project by Mario Cruz, with negligible spiritual support from Cristina Solana and Rebekah Monson, and was built on a RaspberryPi computer and made at Moonlighter Makerspace, where fine Miami nerds come together to make cool things.
